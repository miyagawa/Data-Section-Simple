NAME
    Data::Section::Simple - Read data from __DATA__

SYNOPSIS
      use Data::Section::Simple qw(get_data_section);

      # Functional interface -- reads from caller package __DATA__
      my $all = get_data_section; # All data in hash reference
      my $foo = get_data_section('foo.html');

      # OO - allows reading from other packages
      my $reader = Data::Section::Simple->new($package);
      my $all = $reader->get_data_section;

      __DATA__

      <html>

      </html>

DESCRIPTION
    Data::Section::Simple is a simple module to extract data from "__DATA__"
    section of the file.

LIMITATIONS
    As the name suggests, this module is a simpler version of the excellent
    Data::Section. If you want more functionalities such as merging data
    sections or changing header patterns, use Data::Section instead.

    This module does not implement caching (yet) which means in every
    "get_data_section" or "get_data_section($name)" this module seeks and
    re-reads the data section. If you want to avoid doing so for the better
    performance, you should implement caching in your own caller code.

BUGS
  __DATA__ appearing elsewhere
    If you data section has literal "__DATA__" in the data section, this
    module might be tricked by that. Although since its pattern match is
    greedy, "__DATA__" appearing *before* the actual data section (i.e. in
    the code) might be okay.

    This is by design -- in theory you can "tell" the DATA handle before
    reading it, but then reloading the data section of the file (handy for
    developing inline templates with PSGI web applications) would fail
    because the pos would be changed.

    If you don't like this design, again, use the superior Data::Section.

  utf8 pragma
    If you enable utf8 pragma in the caller's package (or the package you're
    inspecting with the OO interface), the data retrieved via
    "get_data_section" is decoded, but otherwise undecoded. There's no
    reliable way for this module to programmatically know whether utf8
    pragma is enabled or not: it's your responsibility to handle them
    correctly.
